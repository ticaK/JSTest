    <!-- Create a PlayerCharacter and a NonPlayerCharacter with a common ancestor Character.
        The characters are located in a 10x10 game field, meaning they have x and y position. 
        All characters appear at a random location. 
        Create those three classes, and make sure you can query where each character is.
        Make sure the Character class cannot be instantiated.
        Add an option to set both x and y ( at the same time ) using a setter
        Keep count of created characters using a static property -->
